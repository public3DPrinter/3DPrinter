= About QextSerialPort =

QextSerialPort provides an interface to old fashioned serial ports for Qt-based applications. It currently supports Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD. 

    http://code.google.com/p/qextserialport/

== Getting started ==

This simplest way to play with this library is using Qt Creator.

You can open the toplevel qextserialport.pro with Qt Creator, or open other xxxx.pro seperately. For example,
 * If want to build shared libaray, open buildlib.pro
 * If want to run examples, open one xxxx.pro

== How to use (1) ==

 * Download the source code.

 * Put the source code in any directory you like. For example, 3rdparty:

            |-- project.pro
            |-- ....
            |-- 3rdparty\
            |     |-- qextserialport\
            |     |

 * Add following line to your qmake project file:

            include(3rdparty/qextserialport/src/qextserialport.pri)

 * Using QextSerialPort in your code. Enjoy it!

            #include "qextserialport.h"
            ....
            QextSerialPort * port = new QextSerialPort();
            ....
            
== How to use (2) ==
It's very easy to compile QextSerialPort directly into your application
(see above section), however, we would prefer to use it as a shared library.

 * Download the source code, and put it in any location you like.

 * Goto qextserialport/buildlib, and run following command to generate library. (Yes, config.pri is not needed.)

          qmake
          make (or nmake)
          sudo make install (or nmake install)

 * Add following line to your project's file

          CONFIG += extserialport

 * Using QextSerialPort in your code. Enjoy it!

            #include "qextserialport.h"
            ....
            QextSerialPort * port = new QextSerialPort();
            ....

== How to use (3) ==

Someone complains that, I want to used !QextSerialPort as a shared or static libaray, but I don't want
to install them to system. OK, let's go...

 * Download the source code, and put it in any location you like.

           |-- yourpath\
           |     |-- qextserialport\
           |     |

 * Create a config.pri file, and put into qextserialport's directory.

           |-- yourpath\
           |     |-- qextserialport\
           |     |     |-- config.pri
           
   * Contents of config_example.pri
  
           # uncomment the following line if you want to use qesp as library
           # QEXTSERIALPORT_LIBRARY = yes

           # uncomment the following line too if you want to use it as static library
           # QEXTSERIALPORT_STATIC = yes

 * Goto qextserialport/buildlib, and run following command to generate library.

           qmake
           make (or nmake)

 * Add following line to your qmake project file. Enjoy it!

           include(pathToQextserialport/src/qextserialport.pri)

== Build (optional) ==

 * Run qmake from the toplevel directory.(If your has create a config.pri file properly, this will generate the library, and then all examples will use the library. Otherwise, qextserialport will be directly compiled into the examples)

           qmake (or qmake -r)
           make (or nmake)

 * Run qdoc3 from the doc directory.

           qdoc3 qextserialport.qdocconf

 * Note: qdoc3 has been renamed to qdoc under Qt5.
